<p class="intro">Personal Background: I am originaly from Ethiopia. I have been in US almost half of my age. I went to tyee high school in Seattle and 
I also went to diffrent colleges and took so many courses. I am married and I have three beautiful kids.</p>

<p class="intro">Professional Background: I have worked so many jobs from cashier, customer service, Admission attendant, CNA to a junior sql database developer.</p>

<p class="intro">Academic Background: I have certificate as sql developer, Microsoft office certificate,customer service rep certificate  . 
Now I am taking associate degree in Full Stuck programming.</p>

<p class="intro">Information/Technology background: I have been working with computer on and off throgh out my life . I went to multiple training school and 
took courses in order to gain knowledge and skills but it took me a while to decide to continu IT as my major field of study.</p>

<p class="intro">Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10 Home and office</p>

<p class="intro">I'd also like to share: I have three kids two toddlers and one pre teen. I am very thank full to have them in my life. Sometimes I found it very dificult taking online courses with having kids. Its very hard to focuse and do all my assignment on time so I have to stay up late. Sometimes I stay awake until 3 am in the morning so as to complete my assignments. 
This makes me eager to do more in my education. </p>
